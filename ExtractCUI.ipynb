and admitted to the medical intensive care unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation despite cpap machine she was also given nebulizer treatments q point four h as well as chest pt the nebulizers were increased to q point one h due to the fact that she continued to have labored breathingdue to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing the patient was intubated on in order to improve oxygenation ventilation and ability to suction a bronchoscopy was performed on which demonstrated marked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent with tracheomalaciaon two silicone stents were placed one in the left main stem twelve x twenty five and one in the trachea sixteen x fourty by dr under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesiaon the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel mask and her oxygen was titrated down to two liters nasal cannula at which time she was transferred to the medical floor on the medical floor the steroids were weaned to off on and the patient was saturating at ninety seven percent on two liters ninety two percent on room airon the patient was seen again by the interventional pulmonology service who agreed that she looked much improved and

impaired gas exchange impaired endurance impaired ventilation and needed help with supine to sit however she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair for approximately one houron motor exam her flexors and extensors of the lower extremities were at the knee at the ankle at the elbows and hips it was felt that this weakness was most likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well as muscle

was ultimately called out to the medical floor on the floor she was progressively weaned to two lnc with nebs better than her baseline five l @home because of clinical exams revealing mild volume overload she was intermittently diuresed she also experienced intermittent shortness of breath with tachypnea but this was thought to be the result of attacks of anxiety with tachypnea after receiving
